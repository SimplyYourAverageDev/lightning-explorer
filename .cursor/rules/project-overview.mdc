This Project is a Wails V2 Project (App) that uses Preact + Tailwind CSS to build an alternative File Explorer for Windows 11 Systems. The UI Design is modern in the minimalist Neo Brutalism style.

This codebase is only written for Windows 11, DO NOT bother implementing support / fallbacks for any other platform!

DO NOT USE shadows and gradients in your UI DESIGN!
