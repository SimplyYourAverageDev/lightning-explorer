In the frontend, all UI components—including context menus—should adopt an 8-bit retro style while retaining a minimalist, zen aesthetic. Use bold, blocky visuals consistent with classic 8-bit design, keep layouts clean and uncluttered, use UPPERCASE typography throughout (headers, menus, buttons), and avoid using bright neon "hacker" green (#00ff00); choose alternative retro colors instead.
